# Hexadecimal

We've talked about bits previously and our computer doesn't think about bits individually. It thinks about bits in groups, typically groups of eight which is called a byte. Hexadecimals has some advantages, starting with thee number of symbols: 16. They are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E and F. The numbers they form are normally prefixed with `0x`.

| Hexadecimal | Decimal | Octal | Bin√°rio |
| ----------- | ------- | ----- | ------- |
| **0**       | **0**   | **0** | **0**   |
| **1**       | **1**   | **1** | **1**   |
| **2**       | **2**   | **2** | 10      |
| **3**       | **3**   | **3** | 11      |
| **4**       | **4**   | **4** | 100     |
| **5**       | **5**   | **5** | 101     |
| **6**       | **6**   | **6** | 110     |
| **7**       | **7**   | **7** | 111     |
| **8**       | **8**   | 10    | 1000    |
| **9**       | **9**   | 11    | 1001    |
| **A**       | 10      | 12    | 1010    |
| **B**       | 11      | 13    | 1011    |
| **C**       | 12      | 14    | 1100    |
| **D**       | 13      | 15    | 1101    |
| **E**       | 14      | 16    | 1110    |
| **F**       | 15      | 17    | 1111    |

Hexadecimal is a really useful representation for binary data. In the next example, we can look those first four digits (first four bits) `0110` is the same range as one hex digit number 6. On the right `1000` can be represent by another hex digit number eight.

If you have a multiple bytes in you CPU and you want to represent multiple bytes in HEX, we can concatenate them.

We can also use hex to transmit binary data over channels where binary data is inconvenience to transfer.

# Binary Data

Binary is a number system that uses only the digits 0 and 1 to represent data. Numbers greater than 1 require multiple digits. Computers handle all data as a stream of binary numbers because from a hardware perspective it's much easier to represent two values with a transistor as a oppose to ten values.

**Decimal (base 10) has digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.**

**Binary (base 2) has digits 0, 1.**

The binary system is the primary language of computing systems. Inside these systems, a binary number consists of a series of eight bits. This series is known as a `byte`. A binary digit is called a `bit`. In the binary schema, the position of each digit determines its decimal value.

# Web servers

The function of a web server is to serve documents to the front-end (browser). Today we have several web servers, including nginx, apache, tomcat, IIS, etc.

We can check the status of a service by running the command below:

```bash
$ systemctl status apache2
$ systemctl status nginx
```

The configuration files for apache and nginx are located in the `/etc/apache2` and `/etc/nginx` folders.

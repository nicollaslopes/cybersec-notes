# BGP

The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is the routing protocol used by **autonomous systems** to exchange information with each other. A dynamic routing protocol designed to exchange routing information between different autonomous systems is BGP.

BGP is crucial to ensuring that traffic is forwarded efficiently and reliably over the Internet. The Internet would be fragmented into isolated networks without the presence of BGP and autonomous systems. In addition, communication between different parts of the world would be much more difficult.

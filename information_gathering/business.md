Some sites we can look for important information are:

* **Linkedin**: Both to search for information about employees and detailed vacancies about the technologies that this company uses (also collect information from the developers' github)
* **Hunter.io**: Site to collect email addresses (you need to create an account)
* **Have I been pwned**: Site to check if any email is in the leaked email database.
* **Pastebin**: Site to upload content.

## Information Gathering methods

### Searching website caches

Another very essential tool is Web Archive. This site basically maps the cache of a domain's pages since its existence. We can use it to search for files that existed a while ago and gather important information.

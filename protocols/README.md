# Protocols

A computer network is the communication between two or more computers capable of exchanging information with each other. Each computer on the network can be called a **Host** and in a network we can have **client** and server **hosts**. The **server** is a host that provides some service to the network and the **client** is a host that consumes some service offered by a server.

It turns out that there are hundreds of different hardware and software, we can have Intel, AMD, Dell, Apple computers as well as different operating systems such as Windows, Linux, FreeBSD, macOS etc. How can these computers exchange information with each other since they are so different?

That's where **Protocols** come in. Protocols ensure that different computers using different hardware and software can communicate.

Let's talk a little about protocols.
